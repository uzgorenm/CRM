# CRM
Customer Relations Management System that kept track of an inventory using a database. Implemented using encapsulation and abstraction to simplify interactions with customers.

CRM 1 is the initial system, one that uses Strings rather than UTStrings to store customers and StringDestroy rather than delete[] to deallocate memory.
CRM 2 is a more sophisticated system that uses abstraction to make storing through memory allocation and deallocation easier.
